#In Python, you can indicate that a variable is intended to be protected by prefixing 
# its name with a single underscore (_). This is a convention to signal that the variable 
# is intended to be accessed only within its class and subclasses, 
# although it's not enforced by the language. Here's an example:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self._name = name       # Protected variable
        self._age = age         # Protected variable

    def _display_info(self):    # Protected method
        print(f"Name: {self._name}, Age: {self._age}")

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int, breed: str):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self._breed = breed     # Protected variable

    def display_dog_info(self):
        self._display_info()    # Accessing protected method
        print(f"Breed: {self._breed}")

# Creating an instance of Dog
dog = Dog("Buddy", 5, "Golden Retriever")
dog.display_dog_info()

# Trying to access the protected variable directly
print(dog._name)  # This will work, but it's against the convention


#Explanation:
#Protected Variables: _name, _age, and _breed are protected variables. 
# The single underscore before their names is a convention that signals 
# they should not be accessed outside the class or its subclasses.
# Protected Method: _display_info() is a protected method, intended to be 
# used only within the class Animal and its subclasses like Dog.
#Accessing Protected Members: The display_dog_info() method in the Dog class 
# accesses the protected method _display_info() and prints the protected variables.


#Note:
#Although you can access the protected variables directly (like dog._name), 
# doing so is discouraged unless you are within a subclass or the class itself. This convention helps in maintaining the integrity of the class's internal state.
