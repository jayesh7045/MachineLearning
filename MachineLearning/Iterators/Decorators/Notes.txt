Decorators in Python are a powerful and flexible tool for modifying or enhancing functions or methods without 
changing their actual code. They are often used for logging, access control, caching, and more.

Basic Concept
A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and extends its behavior without 
explicitly modifying it. It returns a new function that typically calls the original function and adds 
additional functionality.
